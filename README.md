# Hero Siege Builder

Hero Siege Builder is a web application designed just for fun and is currently in its alpha version.  

It allows users to create and share character builds via link or file.  

It doesn't perform any stat calculations—its purpose is simply to share builds in a readable format.  

The app runs on Cloudflare Workers (Free Tier), so loading builds via links may not always be available.  

## Features

- **Build Creation** – Choose a class, skills, and equipment.  
- **Equipment Editor** – Customize and edit equipment for your build.  
- **Skill Trees** – View and modify skill trees for each class.  
- **Subskill Trees** – Explore and configure subskills within the main skill tree.  
- **Build Sharing** – Save your build and share it via a link or file.
